Class & object in Java :

	1. A class is often defined as the blueprint or template for an object. We can create multiple objects from a class.

	2. An object is an identifiable entity with some characteristics, state and behaviour.

	3. Memory is allocated when we create the objects of a class type. 
		A class contains properties and methods to define the state and behaviour of its object. 
		It defines the data and the methods that act upon that data.
		
Example :

   A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behaviors â€“ wagging the tail, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.
   
   
Syntax Of Class :

		   class class_name
		   {
				Variables ;
				Methods ;
		   }
		   
Syntax Of Object :

			Class_Name ReferenceVariable ( or ) Object = new Class_Name ( ) ;
			
			


Example 1:


//Class & Object in Java
class Rectangle
{
    int length, width;
 
    void getDetails(int x, int y) {
        length = x;
        width = y;
    }
    int area() {
        int a = length * width;
        return a;
    }
}
class class_object {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Rectangle o1 =new Rectangle();
        o1.length=10;
        o1.width=20;
        System.out.println("Area of Rectangle : "+o1.area());
 
 
        Rectangle o2=new Rectangle();
        o2.getDetails(20,30);
        System.out.println("Area of Rectangle : "+o2.area());
 
    }
}
