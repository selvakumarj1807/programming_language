Directory List: 
	
	<dir>...</dir> - Represents a list of file names with bullet points


	The dir tag in HTML was used to create a directory list, which is a list of files or folders, each represented by a li element. 
	However, the dir tag has been deprecated in HTML5 and should not be used in modern web development. 
	Instead, it is recommended to use the unordered list (ul) or ordered list (ol) tags to create lists in HTML.
