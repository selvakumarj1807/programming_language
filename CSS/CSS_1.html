Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) :

	CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a styling language used to add visual style and layout to web documents written in HTML and XHTML. 
	With CSS, web developers can separate the presentation of a web page from its content, 
	making it easier to manage and update the appearance of a website.

	CSS works by providing a set of rules that define how HTML elements should be displayed on a web page. 
	These rules include things like font size, color, spacing, and positioning, 
	as well as more complex properties like animations and transitions.
	
	
		1. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
		
		2. CSS defines how HTML elements are to be displayed
		
		3. CSS saves a lot of work
		
		4. External Style Sheets are stored in CSS files

CSS Selectors : 

	CSS selectors are the heart of the Cascading Style Sheets language. 
	Selectors enable web developers to target specific HTML elements on a web page and apply styling to them. 
	By using selectors, developers can create a visual style and layout for their web page, which is separate from the HTML content.

	There are several types of selectors that can be used in CSS. 
	The simplest selector is the type selector, which targets all instances of a particular HTML element on a page. 
	
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) HTML elements based on their.Mainly used Selectors are following :

		1. Element( tagname)
		
		2. ID (#)
		
		3. Class (.)
		
		4. Univercel Selectors (*)
