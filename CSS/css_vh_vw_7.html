CSS - vh :
	
	This stands for view height. 
	If we want our element to have exactly the same height as your viewport/ view window then use 100vh to denote that.

	Mainly used for pages that occupy the entire height of the viewport.

CSS - vw :

	vw stands for View Width. 100vw means 100% the width of the viewport/view window.
