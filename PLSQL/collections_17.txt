Collections In Oracle Database :
--------------------------------

		A homogeneous single dimension data structure which is made up of elements of same datatype is called collection in Oracle Database. 
		In simple language we can say that, an array in Oracle Database is called Collection.
		
Why we call collection a homogeneous data structure? :
------------------------------------------------------

		1. As we know that array consists data of same datatype and so does the PL/SQL collection 
			which is why we call them homogeneous data structure.
			
		2. The structure of PL/SQL collections consist of a cell with subscript called index. 
			Data is stored into these cells and can be identified and accessed using the index number. 
			This is again very similar to the structure of arrays, but unlike array PL/SQL Collections are strictly one-dimensional.
			
Types of PL/SQL Collections in Oracle Database :
------------------------------------------------

				1. Persistent and
				2. Non-persistent.


		Persistent collection, as the name suggests, are those which physically store the collection structure with 
		the data into the database and can be accessed again if needed. Whereas non-persistent collection only stores data 
		and structure for one session.


1. Persistent :
---------------
				
		1. Nested Tables
		2. Variable Sized Arrays or VARRAY's
		
2. Non-persistent :
-------------------

		1. Associative arrays.
