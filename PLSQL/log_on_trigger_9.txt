Schema Level Database LOGON Trigger In PL/SQL :

		Database event triggers also known as system event triggers come into action 
		when some system event occurs such as database log on, log off, start up or shut down. 
		These types of triggers are majorly used for monitoring activity of the system events 
		and have been proved quite a powerful tool for a DBA.
		
Types of Database Event Triggers :

		1. Schema Level Event Triggers
		2. Database Level Event Triggers
		
			Schema level event triggers can work on some specific schemas while the database 
			event triggers have database wide scope. In other words database event triggers can be 
			created to monitor the system event activities of either a specific user/schema or the whole database.
			
Object/System Privileges :

go to cmd :

		1. sqlplus / as sysdba
		
		2. grant connect to hr;
		
		3. grant connect to hr identified by admin;
		
		4. grant all privilege to hr identified by admin;
		



LOGON Trigger :
Example :
-------------------

CREATE TABLE hr_evnt_audit
  (
    event_type VARCHAR2(30),
    logon_date DATE,
    logon_time VARCHAR2(15),
    logof_date DATE,
    logof_time VARCHAR2(15)
  );
  
  
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER hr_lgon_audit
AFTER LOGON ON SCHEMA
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO hr_evnt_audit VALUES(
    ora_sysevent,
    sysdate,
    TO_CHAR(sysdate, 'hh24:mi:ss'),
    NULL,
    NULL
  );
  COMMIT;
END;
/

select * from hr_evnt_audit;

DISC;

conn hr/admin;


select * from hr_evnt_audit;

LOGOFF Trigger :
-----------------

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER log_off_audit
BEFORE LOGOFF ON SCHEMA
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO hr_evnt_audit VALUES(
    ora_sysevent,
    NULL,
    NULL,
    SYSDATE,
    TO_CHAR(sysdate, 'hh24:mi:ss')
  );
  COMMIT;
END;
/

select * from hr_evnt_audit;

-- once check the log off and log on your schema

 Logoff to the database :
 
		As only the user with ADMINISTER DATABASE TRIGGER system privilege can create a 
		database level event trigger thus we need to make sure that this time we should 
		log on to the database using one of these users.
		
------------------------------------------------
		
CREATE TABLE db_evnt_audit
  (
User_name VARCHAR2(15),
    event_type VARCHAR2(30),
    logon_date DATE,
    logon_time VARCHAR2(15),
    logof_date DATE,
    logof_time VARCHAR2(15)
  );
  
  
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER db_lgof_audit
BEFORE LOGOFF ON DATABASE
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO db_evnt_audit 
  VALUES(
    user,
    ora_sysevent,
    NULL,
    NULL,
    SYSDATE,
    TO_CHAR(sysdate, 'hh24:mi:ss')
    );
COMMIT;
END;
/

select * from db_evnt_audit;
