Triggers :

		Triggers are named PL/SQL blocks which are stored in the database.  
		We can also say that they are specialized stored programs which execute implicitly when a triggering event occurs. 
		This means we cannot call and execute them directly instead they only get triggered by events in the database.
		
Events Which Fires the Database Triggers :

	1. These events can be anything such as
		
		
		1. A DML Statement :
		
			An Update, Insert or Delete statement executing on any table of your database. 
			You can program your trigger to execute either BEFORE or AFTER executing your DML statement. 
			For example, you can create a trigger which will get fired Before the Update. 
			Similarly, you can create a trigger which will get triggered after the execution of your INSERT DML statement.
		
		2. A DDL Statement :
		
			Next type of triggering statement can be a DDL Statement such as CREATE or ALTER. 
			These triggers can also be executed either BEFORE or AFTER the execution of your DDL statement. 
			These triggers are generally used by DBAs for auditing purposes. 
			And they really come in handy when you want to keep an eye on the various changes on your schema. 
			For instance, who created the object or which user. Just like some cool spy tricks.
		
		3. A system event :
		
			Yes, you can create a trigger on a system event. 
			And by a system event, I mean shut down or startup of your database.
		
		4. A User Events :
		
			 Another type of triggering event can be User Events such as log off or log on onto your database. 
			 You can create a trigger which will either execute before or after the event. 
			 Furthermore, it will record the information such as time of event occur, the username who created it.
			 
			 
Types of Database Triggers :


	1. Data Manipulation Language Triggers or DML triggers
		
	2. Data Definition Language Triggers or DDL triggers.

	3. System or Database Event triggers.
	
	4. Instead-of Trigger
	
	5. Compound triggers
	
	
The Syntax Of Database Trigger :

CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER Ttrigger_name
{BEFORE|AFTER} Triggering_event ON table_name
[FOR EACH ROW]
[FOLLOWS another_trigger_name]
[ENABLE/DISABLE]
[WHEN condition]
DECLARE
  declaration statements
BEGIN
  executable statements
EXCEPTION
  exception-handling statements
END;



Uses of Database triggers :

	1. Using database triggers we can enforce business rules that canâ€™t be defined by using integrity constants.
	2. Using triggers we can gain strong control over the security.
	3. We can also collect statistical information on the table access.
	4. We can automatically generate values for derived columns such as auto increment numeric primary key.
	5. Using database triggers we can prevent the invalid transactions.

--Schema & Database Auditing Using DDL Trigger In PL/SQL :


--DDL Trigger for Schema Auditing :

CREATE TABLE schema_audit
  (
    ddl_date       DATE,
    ddl_user       VARCHAR2(15),
    object_created VARCHAR2(15),
    object_name    VARCHAR2(15),
    ddl_operation  VARCHAR2(15)
  );
  
  
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER hr_audit_tr 
AFTER DDL ON SCHEMA
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO schema_audit VALUES (
sysdate, 
sys_context('USERENV','CURRENT_USER'), 
ora_dict_obj_type, 
ora_dict_obj_name, 
ora_sysevent);
END;
/


select * from schema_audit;

create table ddltriger (ddltr varchar2 (20));

insert into ddltriger values ('ddltriggervalue1');

select * from ddltriger;

TRUNCATE TABLE ddltriger;

select * from schema_audit;


drop table ddltriger;

select * from schema_audit;

drop trigger hr_audit_tr;

drop table schema_audit;

/*
DML Triggers
DML triggers are executed in response to DML events such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE on a table or view. 
These triggers can be defined to execute either before or after the triggering DML event.
*/

--1. Create the record_management table:

CREATE TABLE record_management (
    employee_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR2(100),
    salary NUMBER
);

--2. Create the employee_audit table:
CREATE TABLE employee_audit (
    audit_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_id NUMBER,
    old_salary NUMBER,
    new_salary NUMBER,
    change_date DATE
);

CREATE SEQUENCE audit_seq START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1;

--3. Create the DML trigger:

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_employee_salary_update
AFTER UPDATE OF salary ON record_management
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO employee_audit (audit_id, employee_id, old_salary, new_salary, change_date)
    VALUES (audit_seq.NEXTVAL, :OLD.employee_id, :OLD.salary, :NEW.salary, SYSDATE);
END;
/

SELECT * FROM employee_audit;

SELECT * FROM record_management;

INSERT INTO record_management (employee_id, name, salary) VALUES (audit_seq.nextval, 'John Doe', 50000);

SELECT * FROM record_management;

SELECT * FROM employee_audit;

UPDATE record_management SET salary = 65000 WHERE employee_id = 1;

SELECT * FROM employee_audit;

drop trigger trg_employee_salary_update;

drop table employee_audit;

drop table record_management;
