 PL/SQL Cursors In Oracle Database :
 -----------------------------------
 
 What is Database Cursor?
 ------------------------
 
		Cursor is a pointer to a memory area called context area. 
		This context area is a memory region inside the Process Global Area or 
		PGA assigned to hold the information about the processing of a SELECT statement or DML Statement 
		such as INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE or MERGE.
		
What is the Context Area?
-------------------------

		The context area is a special memory region inside the Process Global Area .
		
This information includes:
--------------------------

		1. Rows returned by a query.
		2. Number of rows processed by a query.
		3. A pointer to the parsed query in the shared pool.
		
	Using cursor you can control the context area as it is a pointer to the same.
	
Advantages of Cursors :
-----------------------

	There are two main advantages of a cursor:

		1. Cursor is names thus you can reference it in your program whenever you want.
		2. Cursor allows you to fetch and process rows returned by a SELECT statement by a row at a time.
		
Types of cursors in oracle database:
------------------------------------
	There are two types of cursors in oracle database:

			1. Implicit cursor
			2. Explicit cursor
			
Implicit Cursors in Oracle Database :
-------------------------------------
		As the name suggests these are the cursors which are automatically created by the oracle server every 
		time an SQL DML statement is executed. User cannot control the behavior of these cursors. 
		Oracle server creates an implicit cursor in the background for any PL/SQL block which executes an SQL statement 
		as long as an explicit cursor does not exist for that SQL statement.
		
Explicit Cursor in oracle database :
------------------------------------

		Explicit cursors are user defined cursors which means user has to create these 
		cursors for any statement which returns more than one row of data. Unlike implicit cursor 
		user has full control of explicit cursor. An explicit cursor can be generated only by naming 
		the cursor in the declaration section of the PL/SQL block.
		
Advantages of Explicit Cursor:
------------------------------

		Since Explicit cursors are user defined hence they give you more programmatic control on your program.
		Explicit cursors are more efficient as compared to implicit cursors as in latters case it is hard to track data errors.
		
Steps for creating an Explicit Cursor :
---------------------------------------
	To create an explicit cursor you need to follow 4 steps. These 4 steps are:

			1. Declare
			2. Open
			3. Fetch
			4. Close
			
1. Declare: How To Declare a Database Cursor?
---------------------------------------------

		1. Declaring a cursor means initializing a cursor into memory. 
		2. You define explicit cursor in declaration section of your PL/SQL block and associate it with the SELECT statement.

Syntax:
-------

			CURSOR cursor_name IS select_statement;

2. Open :

		1. In order to put that cursor to work we have to open it first.
		2. when you open a cursor the memory will be allotted to it.
		
Syntax :
--------
			OPEN cursor_name;

3. Fetch: How to retrieve data from cursor?
-------------------------------------------
		1. The process of retrieving the data from the cursor is called fetching. 
		2. Once the cursor is declared and opened then you can retrieve the data from it.
		
Syntax :
--------
			FETCH cursor_name INTO PL/SQL variable;
			Or 
			FETCH cursor_name INTO PL/SQL record;

4. Close:
---------			
		1. Once you are done working with your cursor it’s advisable to close it. 
		2. As soon as the server comes across the closing statement of a cursor it will relinquish all the resources associated with it.

Syntax:
-------
			CLOSE cursor_name;
			

Basic Programming Structure of the Cursor :
--------------------------------------------
	Here is the basic programming structure of the cursor in oracle database.

			DECLARE
				CURSOR cursor_name IS select_statement; 
			BEGIN
				 OPEN cursor_name;
				 FETCH cursor_name INTO PL/SQL variable [PL/SQL record]; 
			CLOSE cursor_name; 
			END;
			/
			
			
			
Cursor Attributes :
-------------------
Oracle provides four attributes which work in correlation with cursors. These attributes are:

			1. %FOUND
			2. %NOTFOUND
			3. %ISOPEN
			4. %ROWCOUNT
			
1. %Found :

		Cursor attribute ‘Found’ is a Boolean attribute which returns TRUE if the previous FETCH command returned a row otherwise it returns FALSE.

2. %NotFound :

		‘Not Found’ cursor attribute is also a Boolean attribute which returns TRUE only when previous 
		FETCH command of the cursor did not return a row otherwise this attribute will return FALSE.

3. %IsOpen :

		Again ‘Is Open’ Cursor attribute is a Boolean attribute which you can use to check 
		whether your cursor is open or not. It returns TRUE if the cursor is open otherwise it returns FALSE.

4. %RowCount :

		Row count cursor attribute is a numeric attribute which means it returns a 
		numeric value as a result and that value will be the number of records fetched from a cursor at that point in time.
