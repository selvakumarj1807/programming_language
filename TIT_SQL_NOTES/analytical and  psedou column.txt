Analytical Function
_________________________

  where clause does not apply 
  that time use aliase name 
  but in where aliase name also does not apply
  so ,take a query in one tempravery table make subquery or 
  then use where condition in aliase name its taken by a coloum name

    select * from( select salary,department_id,dense_rank()
    over(partition by department_id order by salary desc)as kvp from employees ) 
    where kvp=1; 

   select * from( select salary,dense_rank()
    over(order by salary desc)as kvp from employees ) 
    where kvp=2; 


select * from (select first_name,salary,department_id,DENSE_RANK() OVER
      ( ORDER BY salary DESC)as kn from employees )
      where department_id=90;

WITH CLAUSE

with emp_salary as 
(
select employee_id,rank() over(order by employee_id)as sl from employees
)
select * from emp_salary where sl=2;
